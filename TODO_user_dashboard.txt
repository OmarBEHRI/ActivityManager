## COMPLETED TASKS:
- ✅ Created get_user_dashboard_data function in dashboard/views.py
- ✅ Updated dashboard view to use dynamic data for USER role

- ✅ Updated "Projets en cours" section with real project data
- ✅ Updated "Mes tickets récents" section with real ticket data

- User participation in tickets: assigned_to OR created_by
- User participation in projects: members field (ManyToMany)
- Average Time of resolution: Keep hardcoded for now
- Make sure to handle cases where user has no projects/tickets

## READY FOR TESTING!
All major implementation tasks are complete. The dashboard now displays real data instead of hardcoded values.
